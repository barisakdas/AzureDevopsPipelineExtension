# AzureDevopsPipelineExtension
An extension for working with pipelines on Azure Devops with Typescript


## You can follow the document page below to create a Pipeline extension on Azure Devops.
`https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-TR/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-build-task?view=azure-devops`

## You can read my article titled 'Azure Devops Pipeline Extension' on my personal blog ('barisakdas.com') for issues such as how things are done and why they are needed.

## Note that there are some requirements to be able to use the project.
## Some of these are: Node.js, Tsc

## In order for the codes in the project and the extension to work, there must be `node-modules` files in the` src` folder. To do this, run the `npm install` command in the file.

## In order for the typescript codes in the extension to work, these codes must be re-created as javascript by the compiler.
## You can achieve this with TypeScriptCompailer (tsc).
